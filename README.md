<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This is a very simple game built in C++ for an introductory computer science class.</p>
<p>It can be ran in Visual Studio, but the terminal window needs to be set to a width of 122 and a height of 40 for it to display properly. As I learn more about programming, I hope to learn how to resize the window within the program itself,
  as well as to just generally expand the features of the game itself.</p>

<h2>Preview</h2>

<p>This is a snippet of how the program currently looks when ran:</p>
